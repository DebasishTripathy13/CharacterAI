This is a simple chatbot application built with Flask and Google's GenerativeAI. It allows users to interact with a character by asking questions and receiving responses based on the character's personality.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up your Google API key:

   - Sign up for the Google Cloud Platform and create a new project.
   - Enable the "Cloud AI Platform" and "Cloud AI Platform Notebooks" APIs.
   - Create an API key and replace `your_api_key_here` in `app.py` with your actual API key.

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the chatbot interface.
